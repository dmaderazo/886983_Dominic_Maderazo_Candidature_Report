While markov chains are not explicitly mentioned in most of the computational methods described above, a basic treatment of this mathematical object will be beneficial for the reader as some of the underlying techniques below rely on some of the properties of markov chains.

A markov chain is a sequence of stochastic processes... copy from other document
