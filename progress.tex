The last 12 months have been spent 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item learning the background biology, the computing languages; Python, R and C++
        \item writing scripts for the process of model selection and analysis for change point
        \item Attending workshops: AMSI Bioinfosummer (2017), SMB (2018), Software Carpentry (2017).
    \end{itemize}

I have also been awarded a Landahl travel grant by the Society for Mathematical Biology in July 2018 to present a poster at the SMB2018 conference.

The last 12 months have been devoted to understanding the mathematical and biological background for alignment based comparative genomics techniques. Some preliminary work has been done using Change Point~\cite{keith2006segmenting} that was presented in a poster at SMB 2018. My primary output in this time has been code written for the purposes of model selection and analysis relating to Change Point.
