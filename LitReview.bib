%{Standard thing to do to align $N$ protein sequences is do $N-1$ pairwise alignments. Some things to watch out for is that the ordering of proteins can come into play. There are benchmarks for MSAs so that you can judge how good your MSA with, by comparing to these benchmarks. A bunch of alignment tools are available. You can make alignments more accurate by including data that's extra over the sequences. Most MSA algorithms are designed in the context of protein sequence alignment.},
