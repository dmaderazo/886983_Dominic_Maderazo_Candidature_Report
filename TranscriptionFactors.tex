Notes:
    Spitz and Furlong: 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Gene regulation occurs through the combined activity of \emph{cis}-regulatory elements. 
        \end{itemize}
    Kazuko et al. (Combinatorial Functions of transcription factors and epigenetics factors in heart development and disease):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In heart development, the presence of transcription factors are not sufficient to drive the development of a heart without chromatin factors. 
            \item The role of chromatin factors is to initiate chromatin remodelling.
            \item Chromatin remodelling allows the DNA to open from tightly packed clusters and permits transcription factors to be able to access the binding sites required for them to execute their function. 
            \item Chromatin remodelling is also an example of an epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of gene expression, since chromatin doesn't make direct changes to the DNA at the sequence level, but instead the accessibility of the DNA to other complexes.
        \end{itemize}
    Mathelier et al. (JASPAR):
        \begin{itemize}
            \item There are repositories and software that exist to catalogue profiles of TFBS like JASPAR. There are also things like the MEME suite which people use to try and identigfy new TFBS.
        \end{itemize}
